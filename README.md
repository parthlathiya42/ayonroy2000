Thanks for visiting my Github Profile. I have recently mentored **15+** hackathons, bootcamps; delivered **10+** technical talks; reviewed **4** technical books. I am also the organizer of India's **1st** Kaggle Days Meetup ( in Delhi NCR).

## If you want to explore a bit about me, here I go -

I love to explore how a **MACHINE** is **LEARNING** and how can I use my adaptive problem-solving skills to help those **ARTIFICAL** brains boost their **INTELLIGENCE**.  
And yes, if you own a startup or if you are hiring, **let's connect**. I love contributing to the success of these rising champions aka the STARTUPS.  
  
📌 **Why?** 

Because Startups act like a catalyst for me to experiment with a lot of **DATA** as a **SCIENTIST**; while I am still an **ENGINEERING** undergraduate studying **COMPUTER SCIENCE** from 2017-2021.  
  
📌 **Where to find me?**  

During summers/winters; you can find me doing Internships, Research all around **INDIA** and on weekends you can find me at Hackathons, Meetups, Conferences around **DELHI-NCR**, because I believe in the power of Community Learning.  
 
📌 **Anything I did for the community?**  

Of course yes, I tried a bit of mine. I take pride in sharing that I brought **KAGGLE** Days Meetup for the first time in India. I also had the opportunity to create a learning ecosystem for 46000+ learners like me.  
  
📌 **"So what? Where do I fit in for you?"** 

You need proof from me for that. And as everything is **DATA** in 2020 ... You need a person who can extract what Data speaks! Well, lucky, you found me. I am really good in playing with data, you know! ✨  
BONUS : I make machines intelligent with my **EXPERIENCE** as an **INTERN**.  
  
📌 **"What will you get if you choose me?"**  

Insights from the Data that drives & impacts growth for your organization. In short, the real essence of DATA as required in 2020!  
  
📌 **"How do I play with DATA exactly?"**

✔️ Working with Regression Algorithms (Linear, Logistic, Polynomial, Ridge, Lasso).  
✔️ Working with ARIMA and LSTMs for time-series forecasting.  
✔️ Working on data gathering pipelines.  
✔️ Working with technologies like Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, Keras, OpenCV, Tensorflow, and PyTorch.  
✔️ Building mathematical models for COMPUTER VISION, Natural Language Processing [ NLP ].  
✔️ Deploying models at scale for your customers.  
✔️ Reading and extracting insights from recent RESEARCH papers.  
✔️ Writing hacky, clean & understandable code.  
  
📌 **Anything else?** 

You name it, I got it! And if I haven't done it before, I learn & try to deliver the best results to you :)  
If you're looking for something specific. Let's talk directly and discuss things over.  

**Looking for an INTERN who can serve as a DATA SCIENTIST, AI/ML ENGINEER with RESEARCH mindset? Want someone to give your VISION the perfect GROWTH trajectory using DATA? \
You got me! ☺️**
